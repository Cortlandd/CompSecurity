<p><strong>Usage Statistics of Product Functions</strong></p>

This helps us to more accurately determine the importance of each function, and guides us in adjusting its priority for research and development. During this process, we only analyze the usage frequency statistics of product functions, and this will never involve users' personal data.</p>

<p><strong>Product Upgrade Statistics</strong></p>
<p>A server connection is required for 360 Security updates. 360 Security checks for program updates, then updates programs and the necessary Trojan horse virus library files, in order to increase defenses against Trojan viruses and to enhance your user experience.</p>
<p>In order to distinguish between different mobile platforms and to provide the most appropriate and useful upgrade services, we ask you to provide your software version number, cell phone IMEI number, phone model information, and system version number. The server uses this data to determine whether an upgrade is necessary, and reports this information to 360 Security so the upgrade may be completed. Only 1% of collected data will be upload to the server. For example, when a user enables automatic updates or manually connects to the network for updates, 360 Security then connects to the server to complete the updates.</p>
