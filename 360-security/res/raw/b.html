    <strong>User Guide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    a) Software Scan Modes.
</p>
<p>
    i)	Quick Scan.  The Software will perform a quick scan of the system when you click the 'Quick Scan' button (a "Quick Scan").  During a Quick Scan, the Software will utilize the built-in  supported vector machine ("QVM") and Cloud Scan (as described below) engines to scan the system's built-in storage only for malware, vulnerabilities and privacy issues before a determination is made relating to the safety status of the device.
</p>
<p>
    ii)	Full Scan.  The Software will perform a full scan of the system when you click the 'Full Scan' button (a "Full Scan").  During a Full Scan, the Software will utilize the built-in QVM and Cloud Scan engines to scan both the system's built-in storage and external SD card for malware, vulnerabilities and privacy issues before a determination is made relating to the safety status of the device. 
</p>
<p>
    b)	Software Features.  The Software provides the functions described below.  When using the Software, your personal information may be collected and/or uploaded for the sake of realizing the basic functions of the Software.
</p>
<p>
    i)	Cloud Scan.  Upon initiation of either a Quick Scan or Full Scan, the Software will also perform a Cloud Scan.  During a Cloud Scan, certain information will be collected from your installed apps, package name, app name and version, developer and the code signing certificate of the installed apps.  This information will be sent to the server to analyze the safety status of each app on your device and address any concerns appropriately.  Cloud Scan is always performed when either a Quick Scan or a Full Scan is performed.  You may deactivate Quick Scan or Full Scan mode if you do not want to effect a Cloud Scan. 
</p>
<p>
    ii)	Vulnerability Fixing.  The Software will perform a vulnerability scan in either Quick Scan or Full Scan mode, as selected by you.  During a vulnerability scan, your system will be scanned for any vulnerabilities that the Software is able to detect.  You will be alerted if the Software locates any vulnerabilities on your device and you will be prompted whether you would like the Software to clean or fix the vulnerabilities found.  Personal data is neither collected nor uploaded during a vulnerability scan. 
</p>
<p>
    iii) Memory Boost.  The Software will scan the memory usage of your device, and if the available memory is too low, you will be advised to perform a memory cleanup.  The memory cleanup process will free system memory by terminating nonessential processes running in the background.  Memory Boost allows you to close these processes one by one or you can add these processes to an ignore list, thus improving the performance of your device.  Additionally, you can choose to enable lock screen power saver to clean up your system when your device is idle and save battery and processing power. 
</p>
<p>
    iv)	Floating Window.  The Software will display a floating bar on the side of the screen if the Floating Window feature is enabled.  The floating bar will pop out and change into a floating window on which you may access certain control toggles and a one-tap button to activate the Memory Boost feature.
</p>
<p>
    v)	Multifunctional Notification (for Android 4.0 and up).  The Software will display a menu within the drop-down notification drawer from which you may set alarm clocks, turn on the flashlight, enter the recent apps screen and improve the performance of your device with a one-tap button to activate Memory Boost.
</p>
<p>
   vi)	Shake and Cleanup.  The Software will detect if you shake your device while it’s unlocked and the launcher is open.  Once a shake is detected, the Software will improve your device's performance (by activating Memory Boost), and calculate a score to evaluate the effect of the shake, taking the amount of memory cleaned and other factors into consideration. 
</p>
<p>
   vii)	Call & SMS Blocker.  The Software provides smart call & SMS blocking services based on a black list and a white list created by you.
</p>
<p>
   viii) Clean & Optimize.  The Software scans system caches and any other app caches, Internet browsing history (including cookies) and useless Android application package ("APK") files, and allows you to clean either all of these with a single click or one by one.
</p>
<p>
   ix)	App Manager.  The Software allows you to easily uninstall/backup user apps and system apps (requires root permission).  App Manager also allows you to manage APK files and move apps between phone memory and your SD card.
</p>
<p>
   x) Contacts Backup.  The Software allows you to back up your contacts, messages, calendar events and the black list in 360 Security to your SD card for future recovery.  The backup file is encrypted and saved only on the installed SD card and will not be sent to any other system.
</p>
<p>
   xi) Find My Phone.  This feature includes a SIM card change alert, remote data deletion, phone location tracking, a remote alarm function and remote locking of your mobile device, among other features.  To use the anti-theft function, a user's 360 account information, IMEI number and phone number must be collected. 
</p>
<p>
   xii)	Data Usage.  This feature includes a Data Usage Monitor and a Mobile Data Firewall.  The Data Usage Monitor monitors and records data usage to provide statistics and reminders about your data usage.  The Mobile Data Firewall allows you to control networking actions of selected software so that you may configure each app as needed to allocate and save data usage.
</p>
<p>
   xiii) Privacy Advisor.  The Privacy Advisor feature contains two privacy protection tools.  One tool is a private message and call log keeper which allows you to designate certain of your phone contacts as "private contacts".  Messages and all call logs with these private contacts are encrypted and stored in this keeper.  The other tool is an app lock, which allows you to lock access to an app selected by you with a graphical password.
