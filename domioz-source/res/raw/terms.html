<h3> ARBITRATION </h3>
<p>
BECAUSE OF THE MUTUAL BENEFITS (SUCH AS REDUCED EXPENSE AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY) WHICH PRIVATE BINDING ARBITRATION CAN PROVIDE BOTH YOU AND DOMINO’S PIZZA, BOTH DOMINO’S PIZZA AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, AND/OR CONTROVERSY RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITES AND APPLICATIONS, OR TO ANY PRODUCTS SOLD BY DOMINO’S PIZZA OR THROUGH THE WEBSITES OR THE APPLICATIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO AND DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1‐16, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.</p>
<p>
Any arbitration pursuant to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use shall be initiated with and conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), whose rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, may be obtained at http://www.adr.org or by calling (800)778‐7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Nothing herein shall prevent Domino’s Pizza or you from obtaining from a court a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo or prevent any irreparable harm pending the arbitration of the underlying claim, dispute, and/or controversy.</p>
<p>
In addition to requirements imposed by law, any arbitrator herein shall be a retired state or federal court judge, or licensed attorney with arbitration experience and at least ten years’ experience as a lawyer, as mutually agreed to by the parties, and shall be subject to disqualification on the same grounds as would apply to a judge of a court of relevant jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall follow controlling law and issue a decision in writing within 45 days of the arbitration hearing with a supporting opinion based on applicable law. If the decision and supporting opinion are not appealed as described below within 90 days of issuance of the decision, then the decision is final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. At either party’s election, such decision and supporting opinion may be appealed to another arbitrator (“appellate arbitrator”), who shall be chosen in the same manner as described above. The appellate arbitrator shall apply to the underlying decision and opinion the same standard for review of civil cases as an appellate court in the relevant jurisdiction and issue a decision in writing with a supporting opinion based on such review and applicable law. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. YOU AND DOMINO’S PIZZA UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, BOTH GIVE UP THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR OTHER CLAIM EITHER MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN. </p>
<p>
Should any term or provision, or portion thereof, be declared void or unenforceable or deemed in contravention of law, it shall be severed and/or modified by the arbitrator or court and the remainder of this agreement shall be enforceable; provided, however, that if the provision above prohibiting class-wide, collective action, consolidated, or other group arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>

    <h3> GENERAL </h3>

If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the failure by Domino's to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Your use of the Websites and Applications following any amendment of these Terms of Use will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.
