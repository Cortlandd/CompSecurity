        <p><strong><u>Our Policy:</u></strong><br>
        Welcome to the web site (the &quot;<strong>Site</strong>&quot;) of Bitstrips, Inc. (&quot;<strong>Bitstrips</strong>&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; and/or &quot;our&quot;). This Site is operated by Bitstrips and has been created to provide information about our company and our platform for building and sharing avatars, comic strips and other graphics, and our related mobile applications and services (together with the Site, the &quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;) to our Services visitors (&quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;). This Privacy Policy sets forth Bitstrips&rsquo; policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (&quot;<strong>Personal Data</strong>&quot;) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Information We Collect:</u></strong><br />
        When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Bitstrips collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Bitstrips and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States and Canada.</strong> </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong>Other Information:</strong></p>
        <p class="indent alt"><strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Bitstrips through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Bitstrips may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Bitstrips affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors&rsquo; Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
        <p class="indent">In operating the Services, we may use a technology called &quot;cookies.&quot; A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a &quot;help&quot; section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services&rsquo; features. While, as described above, you may have the opportunity to control the use of cookies through your web browser, we do not currently respond to web browser &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals or other similar mechanisms.  If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.  For more information about Do Not Track, please visit <a ng-click="view_it('http://www.allaboutdnt.org')">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>
        <p class="indent alt"><strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Bitstrips often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Bitstrips may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Bitstrips may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
        <p class="indent alt"> <strong>Third-Party Analytics Providers:</strong> Bitstrips uses third party analytics providers ( &quot;TPAPs &quot;), such as Google Analytics, to enhance the user experience when you use the Services.  No Personal Data will be passed along to TPAPs through your use of the Services; however, you acknowledge that some of the data we collect through TPAPs could be connected to other user data you provide in a way that would make the combination of that data Personal Data. Any Personal Data resulting from data gathered through TPAPs will be treated as such, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  By using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the collection of data (including data that could be combined with other data available through the Services to result in Personal Data) through TPAPs, as used in providing you the Services.  </p>
        <p>We have implemented Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). You can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by using Google's Ads Settings or going to <a ng-click="view_it('https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/')">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</u></strong><br>
        Bitstrips uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Bitstrips and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &quot;Related Companies&quot;) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Bitstrips and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. </p>
        <p>If Bitstrips intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</u></strong><br>
        Bitstrips is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.

However, please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Bitstrips shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Services that may be enabled within the Services. </p>

        <p><strong><u>Disclaimer of Warranties</u></strong><br>
        YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS. BITSTRIPS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p>BITSTRIPS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Limitation of Liability</u></strong><br>
        YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BITSTRIPS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF BITSTRIPS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE.

        <p><strong><u>Arbitration</u></strong><br>
        At Bitstrips&rsquo;s or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service.  The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party.  The arbitrator's decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.  The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding.  Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.  The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if Bitstrips changes this 'Arbitration' section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &quot;Date of Last Revision&quot; date above or in the date of Bitstrips&rsquo;s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Bitstrips in accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>
        <p><strong><u>Termination</u></strong><br>
        You agree that Bitstrips, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Bitstrips believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Bitstrips may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Bitstrips may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Bitstrips will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
        <p><strong><u>User Disputes</u></strong><br>
        You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and Bitstrips will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.  Bitstrips reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>
        <p><strong><u>General</u></strong><br>
        These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Bitstrips and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Bitstrips with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the laws of the Province of Ontario and the Federal laws of Canada without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Bitstrips agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial and federal courts located within Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The failure of Bitstrips to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Bitstrips, but Bitstrips may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
