And as expected, one of them has rapidly intensified. Unfortunately, it is the one that's almost guaranteed to affect more land masses in the days ahead.</p><p>Typhoon Goni had top sustained winds of 120 mph as of 11 p.m. EDT Monday, making it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the&nbsp;Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Goni&nbsp;began a period of rapid intensification Monday morning (Sunday evening mainland U.S. time) while moving west away from Guam and Saipan. Winds increased 60 mph in the 24 hours from 5 a.m. EDT Sunday to 5 a.m. EDT Monday, according to the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. This includes an increase of 40 mph in just six hours late Sunday from 5 p.m. EDT to 11 p.m. EDT. This is the equivalent of jumping from Category 1 to Category 4.</p><p>Goni affected Guam and Saipan as a tropical storm with strong winds and heavy rain Friday through Sunday, and will likely threaten parts of East Asia late this week.</p><p>Meanwhile, Typhoon Atsani is churning several hundred miles to the east of Goni and developing more gradually. Atsani had maximum sustained winds equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane as of 11 p.m. EDT Monday.</p><p>(<strong>SOUDELOR RECAPS: Impacts | Reports | Images |&nbsp;Rain Visualization</strong>)</p><p><div id=\"wxn3\" /></p><p>With low wind shear, a moist&nbsp;atmosphere and ample ocean heat content, it's possible that both Goni and Atsani could become super typhoons at some point this week if top winds reach or exceed 150 mph.</p><p>(<strong>FLASHBACK:&nbsp;Six Tropical Cyclones At Once</strong>)</p><h3><strong>Two Threats to Asia Ahead?</strong></h3><p><div id=\"wxn4\" /></p><p>Steered by high pressure aloft just south of mainland Japan, Goni may eventually bring at least some impacts to the northern Philippines, Taiwan or Japan's Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, late in the new week ahead or this weekend. As Goni approaches the Pacific waters in the general vicinity of those countries, it will begin to turn north over the western Pacific. Where this northward turn occurs will dictate exactly where and when we will see the worst impacts. Also, the forecast calls for Goni to begin weakening by that point, however it will likely still remain a dangerous typhoon.</p><p>(<strong>FORECASTS: Taipei | Shanghai</strong>)</p><p><div id=\"wxn5\" /></p><p>Of course, any scenario that takes the eye of Goni directly over Taiwan will mean significant impacts on Taiwan, but also a significantly weaker tropical cyclone for anyone affected by Goni after that. Uncertainty remains high with where Goni will head after this coming weekend. In recent days, some computer model runs have taken Goni near eastern China or the Korean Peninsula, while others have sharply turned it towards southern mainland Japan. It's far too early to know the ultimate outcome.</p><p>But that's just the first typhoon. What about its twin to the east, Typhoon Atsani?</p><p>Current indications suggest the eastern system, instead of following in the wake of the first system, will instead track more toward the northwest in the days ahead.</p><p>This is expected to occur thanks to a weakening upper-atmospheric high pressure zone to its north. This will keep Atsani well northeast of Saipan and Guam.</p><p><div id=\"wxn6\" /></p><p>However, Atsani may eventually pose a threat to mainland Japan late this coming weekend or early in the following week, if the jet stream doesn't curve it into the open waters of the north Pacific Ocean in time.</p><p>Monday morning's computer model forecasts continued to disagree on this point, with America's GFS model favoring a sharper recurvature and a lower risk for the Japanese mainland, and Europe's ECMWF model favoring a more ominous track that could bring a strong and slow-moving typhoon close to Tokyo in about 10 days.</p><p>(<strong>FORECAST: Tokyo | Osaka</strong>)</p><p>Both models indicate there is some risk of Typhoon Atsani having some impact on the small Izu and Ogasawara island chains lying south of Tokyo and north of the Northern Marianas. Again, this is more than seven days out, and the forecast can and likely will change.</p><p>Whatever Atsani's ultimate path, it is likely to be an extremely powerful typhoon over the open waters of the Pacific. As of early Sunday afternoon, the five most recent runs of the American GFS model all showed Atsani's central pressure dropping below 880 millibars, or 25.99 inches of mercury â€“ something that hasn't been recorded in a tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth since Typhoon Tip established the world record of 870 millibars in late 1979.</p><p>In general, the lower the central pressure in a typhoon or hurricane, the stronger the winds.</p><p>(<strong>MORE: Expert Analysis | Hurricane Central</strong>)</p><p>Interests in the western Pacific, including Taiwan, Japan, the northern Philippines and eastern China should monitor closely the progress of each of these typhoons.</p><h3><strong>Saipan and Guam Impacted By Heavy Rain, Strong Winds</strong></h3><p>Over the past weekend, Goni affected Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands as a tropical storm.</p><p>Tropical storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) occurred as the center passed through the islands. Off&nbsp;Saipan, a sustained tropical storm-force wind of 43 mph was reported just before 11 p.m. local time (7 a.m. EDT) Saturday. A peak gust of 61 mph was recorded there at 10:23 p.m.</p><p>On Guam, Andersen Air Force Base clocked a 49-mph sustained wind at just before 5 a.m. local time Sunday (3 p.m. EDT Saturday), with gusts to 58 mph, as a heavy rain band lashed the northern end of Guam. Guam International Airport near Hagatna, Guam's capital, gusted as high as 46 mph at 5:28 a.m. local time Sunday.</p><p>Heavy rain arrived Saturday and continued Sunday, prompting flash flood warnings for Guam and Rota. Guam International Airport reported 13.86 inches of rain Friday through 4 p.m. local time Sunday. (Guam is 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Daylight Time.)</p><p>This is the second tropical cyclone to affect Saipan in the last two weeks. The island is still struggling to recover from Typhoon Soudelor.</p><p>The Pacific News Center reported about 4,000 households in Saipan, or over 25 percent, have requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&nbsp;</p><p>Power outages and a lack of running water and food have plagued the 44-square-mile island about 135 miles northeast of Guam since an intensifying Soudelor&nbsp;hit the island square on Aug. 2.</p><p>(<strong>WATCH: Saipan Struggles After </strong><strong>Soudelor</strong>)</p><p>Guam's main newspaper, the Pacific Daily News, says some families on Guam are also recovering from typhoon damage â€“ in their case, damage from Typhoon Dolphin back in May. Dolphin's eyewall passed over Guam, delivering gusts as high as 106 mph to the northern end of the island.</p><h3><strong>Active Northwest Pacific Typhoon Season</strong></h3><p>Including the two current typhoons and Halola, which migrated westward from the central Pacific basin, there have already been 16 named storms so far this year in the Northwest Pacific basin. Fourteen of those have become typhoons -- equivalent to hurricanes -- and five of those (Maysak, Noul, Dolphin, Nangka and Soudelor) became \"super typhoons\", packing sustained winds estimated of at least 150 mph.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Colorado State University scientist, Dr. Phil Klotzbach, the Northwest Pacific basin had seen record levels of year-to-date tropical cyclone activity through early August, as measured by the accumulated cyclone energy or ACE index.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Meteorologist Chris Dolce contributed to this report.</em></p><h3>MORE ON WEATHER.COM: Typhoon Soudelor Photos</h3><p><div id=\"wxn7\" /></p>",

No tropical depressions or named storms have formed yet this month, largely due to unfavorable upper-level winds and dry air.</p><p>August is the first month of a period that runs through September and into early October where we typically look farther east into the Atlantic for development. This is in addition to the typical formation areas that are closer to the United States.</p><p>(<strong>MORE: Heart of the Hurricane Season is Here</strong>)</p><p>Right now, we have our eyes on an area of interest in the far eastern Atlantic dubbed Invest 96-L. This is a naming convention used by the National Hurricane Center to identify features they are monitoring for potential future development into a tropical depression or a tropical storm. For more details on what an Invest is, click the link below.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:&nbsp;What is an Invest?</strong>)</p><p>The National Hurricane Center has given Invest 96-L a 8<strong>0 percent chance (high chance)</strong> of further development into a tropical depression or tropical storm over the next five days as it tracks west-northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean.</p><p><div id=\"wxn1\" /></p><p><div id=\"wxn2\" /></p><p>As of Monday evening, satellite imagery showed some clusters of showers and thunderstorms becoming better organized in association with Invest 96-L to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. This is being driven by an area of low pressure near the surface of the earth that has a spin to it that is clearly evident on satellite imagery. If showers and thunderstorms can persist in tandem with this spin, then we could see further development into a tropical depression.</p><p>At the moment, winds aloft in the area near Invest 96-L are not too strong and the environment is somewhat moist. This is why it's being given a high chance of development at this time.</p><p>Is this a reason to be concerned? Since Invest 96-L is well away from any land areas at this time, we have plenty of time to monitor its progress. As mentioned before, dry air and unfavorable upper winds have dominated the Atlantic so far this month, so we'll see if Invest 96-L can survive the journey to a longitude near the Lesser Antilles over the next week to ten days.</p><p>Stay tuned to The Weather Channel and check back with weather.com for updates in Invest 96-L.</p><h3><strong>No Named Storms in August: How Rare?</strong></h3><p>The month of August is typically active in the Atlantic, averaging about two named storms annually (1851-2014).</p><p>It's not very often we go through an entire August without a single active named storm. In fact, the last time it happened was 18 years ago in August 1997. Before that you have to go back to 1961 to find an August with no named storms.</p><p>It is perhaps no coincidence that a strong El Nino was in its early stages during August 1997, similar in some ways to what is happening this year. El Nino, a warming of the waters in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, is often associated with increased wind shear over the Atlantic Basin. That can make it difficult for tropical waves emerging from Africa to survive the westward journey across the Atlantic.</p><p><em>Senior meteorologist Nick Wiltgen contributed to this report.</em></p><h3>MORE ON WEATHER.COM: Hurricanes by the Numbers</h3><p><div id=\"wxn3\" /></p>",

Hundreds of homes remain evacuated, however, and crews are worried that the flames are getting closer to more residences.</p><p>The wildfires have already burned more than 155 square miles in central Washington, pushing some 1,500 people from their homes.</p><p><strong>(MORE:&nbsp;Why You Need a Severe Weather Plan for Outdoor Events)</strong></p><p><div id=\"wxn2\" /></p><p>Officials say more than 50 structures have been destroyed and the number is likely to go higher. A warehouse was also destroyed by the flames, and 1.8 million pounds of apples were inside the building. Hundreds of job may be impacted by the loss of that building.</p><p>Patterson said air tankers have established lines to keep the flames from reaching downtown Chelan. Helicopters have been dipping into Lake Chelan to pull up water to battle blazes north of the lake.</p><p>\"There were literally people on the beaches near that lake in their swim wear out on the lake right near it,\" Patterson told the Associated Press.</p><h3><strong>Idaho</strong></h3><p>The Idaho County Sheriff's Department said a 70-year-old woman died Friday while preparing to flee one of several wildfires burning in the parched Western states.</p><p>Cheryl Lee Wissler of Adams Grade died Friday from a head injury she sustained when she fell, authorities said. She was attempting to evacuate as a wildfire quickly expanded east of Lewiston.</p><p><strong>(MORE:&nbsp;Multi-Day Severe Weather Threat Ahead)</strong></p><p>An estimated 42 homes and 79 other structures were lost to the blaze, the sheriff's department said. The fire is surrounding the small town of Kamiah, about 60 miles east of Lewiston, and burned to the edge of Clearwater River, directly across the water from downtown.</p><p>More than 750 people were assigned to fight several fires that together have charred more than 50 square miles in the area near Kamiah.</p><p>Wind patterns near Kamiah were expected to slow down slightly on Monday, giving firefighters a break from the previously constant 25-mph gusts that pushed the fire dangerously close to homes, said Ryan Greendeer, a spokesman for the Clearwater Complex fire.</p><p>The region was already struggling after severe drought damaged wheat harvests, with farmers watching as their normally plump wheat kernels grew pinched and stunted from the lack of water. Though most of the wheat had been cut before the fires started, bone-dry stubble still covers the prairie and the forests surrounding Kamiah are parched.</p><h3><strong>California</strong></h3><p>Light winds helped crews increase containment of a wildfire that destroyed several cabins and charred nearly 2-and-a-half square miles of forest near Los Angeles.</p><p>Officials revised the size of the fire downward after previous estimates put it at nearly 4 square miles.</p><p>The blaze in the Angeles National Forest above the suburbs of Glendora and Azusa was 20 percent contained and holding steady Sunday.</p><p>Six campgrounds remained evacuated around the fire that burned four cabins and an outbuilding when it broke out on Friday.</p><p>Ten firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion, dehydration and minor injuries.</p><p><strong>(MORE:&nbsp;Eye-Opening Numbers Reveal California's Intense Battle with Dangerous 2015 Fire Season)</strong></p><p><div id=\"wxn3\" /></p><p>A wildfire that was sparked near a former rehabilitation center in Castaic Sunday burned three structures before spreading to at least 500 acres in the Angeles National Forest, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a brush fire started near a riverbed in Montebello, a suburb 8 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, halted operations at an oil field, prompted the evacuation of a park and road closures.</p><p>A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson, Montebello Fire Department Deputy Chief Dan Amador told the Whittier Daily News.</p><p>A Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter made a hard landing while assisting in the firefight, causing a minor injury to a crew member, fire Inspector Chris Reade said.</p><p>The fire, which grew to about 200 acres, was 20 percent contained</p><p>In Northern California, firefighters made more gains against a wildfire 100 miles north of San Francisco that forced mountain-town dwellers to evacuate for the second time in days. Wind shifts sent smoke from the fire all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area, where residents turned to social media to report the haze. The National Weather Service said smoky conditions were likely to remain in the area throughout the weekend.</p><p>Two fires have charred dry Lower Lake, the most recent burning 39 square miles of thick brush and oak trees in Lake and Napa counties. It was 82 percent contained by Sunday.</p><p>An earlier, larger fire in the same area was fully contained Friday more than two weeks after it broke out. The blaze destroyed 43 homes.</p><h3><b>Colorado</b></h3><p>Lightning storms across northwest Colorado are being blamed for several wildfires, including one north of Craig that was estimated at more than 1,000 acres. The Bureau of Land Management says no injuries have been reported and one home was evacuated.&nbsp; It was 80 percent contained Monday.</p><p>The Northwest Colorado Fire Management Unit says nine fires were ignited Saturday.</p><p>Firefighters say the fires were pushed in multiple directions by erratic winds from passing storms.</p><h3><strong>Montana</strong></h3><p>So many wildfires have ignited across the Northern Rockies this month that fire officials are allowing some that might be suppressed under normal circumstances to burn because manpower and equipment are committed elsewhere.</p><p>There were 86 active fires burning across Montana and Idaho as of Monday, and seven in Montana were listed as unstaffed due to a lack of resources, according to the Northern Rockies Coordination Center. All seven are small fires burning in remote areas in northwestern Montana.</p><p>\"Every fire engine out there is on a fire,\" coordination center spokeswoman Liz Slown said. \"Everything's being used and everything's being cycled through as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>Fire officials are watching those fires and will reallocate resources if they pose a threat to public safety, she said. Also, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock declared a state of emergency over the weekend that will free up the Montana National Guard and additional state resources to help fight the fires.</p><p>Last week's hot weather and lightning-packed storms helped ignite dozens of new fires in drought-parched areas of western Montana from east of Dillon to the Canadian border.</p><p>The new starts raised the national priority level for the region â€” which includes Idaho, Montana and parts of North Dakota and South Dakota â€” to the highest point on the 1-5 scale, Slown said.</p><p>\"The fires in the Northwest have first priority, we have second priority,\" she said. \"Even though we have been moved up to a higher priority, there are just so many resources.\"</p><p><div id=\"wxn4\" /></p>",

      "body": "<p><div id=\"wxn0\" /></p><p>When the National Weather Service issues \"excessive heat warnings\" for the hottest region of the country, you know it's hot. And when Phoenix ties its all-time August record high, you know it's <em>really </em>hot.</p><p>The bubble of high pressure responsible for the last week's heat wave in Texas and Louisiana has shifted westward to Arizona, putting the Desert Southwest in the hot seat. Excessive heat warnings remain in effect for parts of the Southwest.</p><p>And it's not just the Southwest that's feeling the heat. Along the central coast of California, Santa Cruz topped out at 101 degrees Saturday, crushing its daily record high for Aug. 15 by 13 degrees. Weather records in Santa Cruz go back 120 years, which makes the margin by which this record was broken very impressive. It is also only the sixth time in those 120 years that Santa Cruz has recorded a triple-digit daily high temperature in the month of August.</p><p>A daily record high of 92 degrees was also set at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday. Sunday's high reached 90 at SFO, breaking another daily record (86 on Aug. 16, 1960). It's only the fourth time SFO has had back-to-back 90-degree days in August since records began there in 1945, and only the fifth time it's had two 90-degree days at all in August. San Francisco's airport has never had three 90-degree August days in the same year, whether consecutive or not.</p><p>Hot temperatures will also build into the Pacific Northwest once again through midweek, threatening several daily record highs. Heat advisories have been issued for Tuesday in parts of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.</p><h3>Southwest: August Records Challenged</h3><p><div id=\"wxn1\" /></p><p><div id=\"wxn2\" /></p><p>At least one major heat record has been established in this heat wave. On Friday, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport recorded a high of 117 degrees, tying the Arizona capital's all-time record high for the month of August previously set Aug. 26, 2011. Like that date, Friday's low was 93, so it also tied for Phoenix's warmest daily mean temperature on record for the month of August.</p><p>Phoenix topped out at 115 degrees on Saturday, which is a new daily record for Aug. 15 (previous record was 112 degrees in 1992).</p><p>(<strong>FORECAST:</strong> Phoenix | Scottsdale | Mesa)</p><p>The health dangers of heat waves are not just a function of high temperatures, though. Very warm overnight lows can cause problems for anyone living without access to air conditioning, or for those who cannot afford the electricity required to take full advantage of their AC.</p><p>In Phoenix, the lows Friday, Saturday and Sunday were a torrid 93 degrees. This is the first time Phoenix has ever recorded three consecutive calendar days without falling below 93. The mercury fell to 91 Monday morning. Phoenix's record for most consecutive lows in the 90s is seven straight days from Aug. 7 through Aug. 13, 2012.</p><p>In a way, to call this a \"pressure cooker\" could be considered more than just a metaphor. The high-pressure zone is literally exerting a downward influence on the air over the Southwest. Since clouds and rainfall require rising air motions (not to mention adequate moisture), large-scale sinking air tends to prevent or inhibit precipitation from developing.</p><p>That means more sunshine, which in turn, means more heat. In addition, the air mass itself is warmer in the first place, so the sun is heating up air that's already toasty to start with.</p><p>Relative to historical norms, the epicenter of the heat has been over central and southern Arizona and southeastern California.</p><p><div id=\"wxn3\" /></p><p>Phoenix's 117-degree high Friday made it the hottest day of 2015, surpassing the 115 recorded June 18. Of the past 20 years (1995 through 2014), Phoenix's annual high temperature has only occurred in August three times: 2012, 2004 and 1999. In 2004 and 1999 August shared the crown with July.</p><p>Death Valley National Park, already the world recordholder for highest official temperature, hit 122 degrees Friday and 123 Saturday, easily clinching the nation's hot spot both days. Saturday's reading was the highest August temperature in Death Valley since 2012. Sunday brought a high of 122 to Death Valley.</p><p><div id=\"wxn4\" /></p><p>The lower elevations of the Las Vegas area and parts of the Colorado River Valley are under excessive heat warnings through Wednesday.&nbsp; If you are in any of these areas, take precautions against the heat. Drink plenty of water, stay in the shade as much as possible, and take a break now and then in an air-conditioned building.</p><p>(<strong>FORECAST:</strong> Tucson | Las Vegas | San Diego)</p><p><div id=\"wxn5\" /></p><p>Excessive heat warnings for inland areas near Los Angeles and San Diego have now expired, as a cooling trend began Monday.</p><p>For cooling over the weekend, Angelenos had to head to the beach. Highs Saturday soared to 107 in the Woodland Hills, Van Nuys and Chatsworth neighborhoods of the city, while Los Angeles International Airport only hit 81, and the famous pier in the neighboring city of Santa Monica only hit 73.</p><p>Highs in the inland valleys will cool into the 90s and eventually 80s this week. More importantly, overnight lows will recede back into the lower 60s, allowing for a break in the warmth at night.</p><p>The Weather Channel smartphone app and weather.com give you forecasts down to neighborhood and zip-code level, so make sure you check the forecast for your specific area of interest to get the forecast most relevant to your plans.</p><p>(<strong>FORECAST:</strong> Downtown L.A. | LAX Airport | Encino)</p><h3>Northwest: Heat Rebuilds, Briefly</h3><p><div id=\"wxn6\" /></p><p>The heat will build again through midweek in the Pacific Northwest, with highs up to 20 degrees above average expected in western parts of Oregon and Washington Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>Portland could top out in the 90s through Wednesday, and will make a run at the century mark on Tuesday. This will give the Portland airport its record twenty-fifth day with highs in the 90s in a calendar year.&nbsp;</p><p>Seattle will likely see highs in the middle to upper 80s Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>Daily record highs will be threatened in the following cities (current record in parentheses):</p><p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Portland (93 degrees); Salem, Oregon (97 degrees); Seattle (89 degrees)</p><p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Seattle (88 degrees); Salem, Oregon (99 degrees); Portland (97 degrees); Eugene, Oregon (101 degrees)</p><p>Cooler air will arrive late week, dropping temperatures closer to average.</p><p>(<strong>FORECAST:</strong>&nbsp;Seattle&nbsp;|&nbsp;Portland&nbsp;|&nbsp;Boise)</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> Latest on Western Wildfires)</p><p><strong>MORE ON WEATHER.COM: Western Wildfires, July 31 - Aug. 11, 2015</strong></p><p><div id=\"wxn7\" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In order to keep an eye on the situation, scientists from the United States Geological Survey and several major universities have joined forces to begin researching what measures forest managers will need to take in order to protect the trees at the highest risk.</p><p>One of the lead authors of the study, Koren Nydick told The Huffington Post, \"The good news is that there were lots of trees that still seem healthy, but there was this smaller amount that seemed to be stressed and stressed in ways that we haven't seen documented before in the parks.â€</p><p><strong>(MORE: Drought Photos That Prove California Is In Deep Trouble)</strong></p><p>The group is studying over 40 of the massive trees. NPR reports that in order to attach the required monitoring devices to the sequoias, researchers must carefully attach ropes and hoist themselves up the massive plants that can grow as high as 30 stories. Near the end of August, scientists will climb the trees once again to collect various clippings for advanced lab testing.</p><p>Drought is not entirely new for some of these trees. Researchers from The University of California at Berkeley claim that some of the sequoias are over 3,000 years old and have survived intense droughts before. The ultimate goal is for scientists to understand what exactly it would take for a drought to kill one of the ancient wonders.</p><p><strong>More On Weather.com: Western Drought By Satellite</strong></p><p><div id=\"wxn1\" /></p>",

The plan hopes to make massive areas like those currently burning in the western wildfires more capable of coping with serious natural disastes.</p><p>The department behind the new program plans to cultivate a large network that includes seed collectors, growers and storage facilities that will amass a large collection of seeds in preparation for major disasters. Quickly planting new seeds will help prevent invasive plants and erosion from taking over in the wake of a land changing event.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(MORE:&nbsp;Aircraft Tries to Extinguish Wildfire)</strong></p><p>\"Having the right seed in the right place at the right time makes a major difference in the health of our landscapes,\" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement.</p><p>The strategy targets Western rangelands, where drought-stricken terrain fuels huge wildfires that have destroyed homes and key animal habitat. For example, a wildfire on the Idaho-Oregon border by Monday had consumed nearly 450 square miles of rangeland needed to feed cattle and habitat for sage grouse, a bird being considered for federal protection.</p><p>The Interior Department said that such destruction requires a national seed strategy to give land managers a way to bolster natural defenses.</p><p>The agency also noted the widespread damage that Hurricane Sandy caused in 2012 to native plant habitats that stabilize soil and absorb storm surges. But a shortage of native seeds left the area vulnerable to erosion and invasive plants, the agency said.</p><p>\"In many cases, it has been difficult to obtain and deliver adequate quantities of the appropriate seed to meet a region's particular need,\" Steve Ellis, deputy director of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, said in a statement.</p><p><strong>More On Weather.com: Western Wildfires</strong></p><p>&nbsp;<div id=\"wxn1\" /></p>",

There are fears that it could be as large as the 1914 eruption that killed 35 people and was the most powerful in Japan in the 20th century, Earthquake Report said.</p><p>Over the past few days, seismic activity began to ramp up at the mountain, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. A level 4 warning was issued Saturday by the JMA, and all residents within a 3-kilometer radius of the mountain were told they should prepare to evacuate.</p><p><strong>(MORE: 12 Volcanoes That Could Erupt at Any Time)</strong></p><p>The alerts remained in place Monday despite a large decline in earthquakes at Sakurajima, the Wall Street Journal said. This is the first level 4 warning issued for Sakurajima since the 5-level scale was developed 8 years ago, the report added.</p><p>\"Right now that [evacuation possibility] is limited to 4,000 people on the same island as Sakurajima, but ash from any eruption (depending on the winds) could impact Kagoshima (population 600,000), located only 10 kilometers from Sakurajima,\" Wired added.</p><p>Simply put, the reason for the concern is that this activity is very similar to what happened in the days leading up to past major eruptions at Sakurajima. Scientists have installed sensors all over the mountain, which have relayed information in the past few days that suggests magma could be rising up the volcano, and that may lead to a large eruption soon, Wired said.</p><p>There is also a nuclear plant in Sendai, just 31 miles from the volcano, that was the first to be restarted in the area after the 2011 tsunami that devastated parts of Japan's east coast, according to the International Business Times.</p><p><strong>MORE ON WEATHER.COM: From 2013&nbsp;â€“ Sakurajima Erupts</strong></p><p><div id=\"wxn3\" /></p>",
